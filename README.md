# Rating/Social App for Broadway Shows

Team Members: Jessica Yo (jay2143), Xian Jiang (xj2281)

## Description
The application is a social platform where users can share, review, and discuss Broadway musicals. Users can follow others, build wishlists of upcoming shows, and rate or comment on musicals they have watched. Users, musicals, showtimes, theatres, and cast/production are key entities. Users can interact by reviewing musicals, finding showtimes, adding favorites to their wishlist, and engaging with other users. Data could be populated from real-world Broadway schedules and actor profiles. The challenge involves managing user interaction, diverse showtime schedules, and personalized recommendations. This model is based on the Beli app, and other social media, that allow a community to interact and find common interests to explore.
